# Diamond-price-analysis
Diamond price analysis given weight in carats
1.	Compute a Pearson Correlation and linear regression to investigate relationship between a diamond’s weight and its price. From the output, identify the following:
    a.	Slope associated with the predictor variable
    b.	Constant for the regression equation
    c.	Mean weight and price of the diamond
    d.	Correlation between weight and diamond. Is the correlation significant?
    e.	Write a regression equation


2.	Also create a scatterplot. Plot the line of best fit (regression line) on the graph. What does the scatterplot indicate regarding the predictability of the dependent variable (price)?

3.	Is the price significantly related to the diamond’s weight?
Interpret the results of the regression analysis to answer the question.


4.	Write a Results section based on your above analysis.
